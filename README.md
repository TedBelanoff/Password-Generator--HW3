This is my submission for HW assignment #3 - Password Generator

The password generator requires an integer entry form the user for password length. If the user chooses an integer greater
than 128 characters or less than 8 characters, the selection of a password length of either the minimum or maximim is made
for the user.

I made no edits to either the index.html or the style.css file. All editing was done to the script.js file.
